## Best-rated Canadian trading platform!

Wealthsimple is a Toronto-based online trading platform that was started in September 2014. This fast-growing Fintech company was founded by Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler.

This platform enables users to invest money and create diverse portfolios using exchange-traded funds. There is no minimum investment requirement and costs are lower than typical trading costs to make investing more accessible to millennials. Contrary to many Robo-advisors, Wealthsimple also offers phone, email, text, and video chat access to real advisors.

## How it started

Michael Katchen developed an Excel model while he was employed by Ancestry.com to provide advice to his coworkers on building investment portfolios. He immediately realized that everyone needed access to smart, straightforward, low-cost investment, which led to the establishment of Wealthsimple in 2014. 

In 2015, Wealthsimple managed $400 million in assets across 10,000 customer accounts after purchasing Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc., Canada's first Robo-advisor service. A partnership with Mint was established in 2016, allowing customers to sync their investment accounts to Mint's budgeting tool. Wealthsimple for Advisors was also launched in 2016, providing an automated platform for financial advisors wishing to maintain clients with accounts below their minimum requirements. Currently, Wealthsimple has more than 65,000 clients worldwide and more than $2 billion in assets under management.

Wealthsimple has been a standout in this sector and ranked as the best Canadian trading platform in the year 2021. This is due to its extremely unconventional marketing strategy instead of providing product details, its advertisements emphasize humour and emotion. Wealthsimple works to convey to consumers that they should carry on living their life and accumulating money while allowing Wealthsimple to take care of them with expert resources such as employees, technology, and tools.

## Recommendations

### Algorithmic trading alerts:
I would personally recommend the company, to add algorithmic trading alerts to the current customers using AI. This could be an added feature with this financial technology platform so that every client is benefitted.

### Financial news and trends:
Even though most of the financial data and stock performances are visualized in the platform, data in regard to trading is limited. This feature could be added by introducing SAS programming and extensive data visualization by creating dashboards using Tableau.

Optimizing these two recommendations can bring growth within the company by 150% within a year, considering ongoing recession which could be the year of investments and the current conditions on peoples understanding of capital markets.
